# @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector

(For PostGraphile v5, use [@graphile/simplify-inflection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphile/simplify-inflection))

This plugin simplifies field names in the PostGraphile schema; e.g. `allUsers`
becomes simply `users`, `User.postsByAuthorId` becomes simply `User.posts`, and
`Post.userByAuthorId` becomes simply `Post.author`.

**Adding this plugin to your schema is almost certainly a breaking change, so do
it before you ship anything!** This is the primary reason this isn't enabled by
default in PostGraphile.

_This plugin is recommended for all PostGraphile users._

## Customising

This plugin is implemented as a single JS file that does not need to be compiled
at all - you can simply copy it into your project and customise it as you see
fit.

Alternatively, you can
[write your own inflection plugin](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/inflection/).

## Changes:

Given these tables:

```sql
create table companies (
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null
);
create table beverages (
  id serial primary key,
  company_id int not null references companies,
  distributor_id int references companies,
  name text not null
);
```

- `Query.allCompanies` ðŸ‘‰ `Query.companies` (disable via
  `pgSimplifyAllRows = false`)
- `Query.allBeverages` ðŸ‘‰ `Query.beverages`
- `Beverage.companyByCompanyId` ðŸ‘‰ `Beverage.company`
- `Beverage.companyByDistributorId` ðŸ‘‰ `Beverage.distributor`
- `Company.beveragesByCompanyId` ðŸ‘‰ `Company.beverages` (because the
  `company_id` column follows the `[table_name]_id` naming convention)
- All update mutations now accept `patch` instead of `companyPatch` /
  `beveragePatch` (disable via `pgSimplifyPatch = false`)
- If you are using `pgSimpleCollections = "only"` then you can set
  `pgOmitListSuffix = true` to omit the `List` suffix
- Fields where the singular and plural are the same and a distinct plural is
  required are force-pluralised ("fishes") to avoid conflicts (e.g.
  `singularize("fish") === pluralize("fish")`).

Note: `Company.beveragesByDistributorId` will remain, because `distributor_id`
does not follow the `[table_name]_id` naming convention, but you could rename
this yourself with a smart comment:

```sql
comment on constraint "beverages_distributor_id_fkey" on "beverages" is
  E'@foreignFieldName distributedBeverages';
```

or with a custom inflector:

```js
module.exports = makeAddInflectorsPlugin(
  {
    getOppositeBaseName(baseName) {
      return (
        {
          // These are the default opposites
          parent: "child",
          child: "parent",
          author: "authored",
          editor: "edited",
          reviewer: "reviewed",

          // ðŸ‘‡ Add/customise this line:
          distributor: "distributed",
        }[baseName] || null
      );
    },
  },
  true
);
```

## Installation:

```bash
yarn add @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector
```

or

```bash
npm install --save @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector
```

## Usage:

CLI:

```bash
postgraphile --append-plugins @graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector
```

Library:

```js
const PgSimplifyInflectorPlugin = require("@graphile-contrib/pg-simplify-inflector");

// ...

app.use(
  postgraphile(process.env.AUTH_DATABASE_URL, "app_public", {
    appendPlugins: [PgSimplifyInflectorPlugin],

    // Optional customisation
    graphileBuildOptions: {
      /*
       * Uncomment if you want simple collections to lose the 'List' suffix
       * (and connections to gain a 'Connection' suffix).
       */
      //pgOmitListSuffix: true,
      /*
       * Uncomment if you want 'userPatch' instead of 'patch' in update
       * mutations.
       */
      //pgSimplifyPatch: false,
      /*
       * Uncomment if you want 'allUsers' instead of 'users' at root level.
       */
      //pgSimplifyAllRows: false,
      /*
       * Uncomment if you want primary key queries and mutations to have
       * `ById` (or similar) suffix; and the `nodeId` queries/mutations
       * to lose their `ByNodeId` suffix.
       */
      // pgShortPk: true,
    },
    // ... other settings ...
  })
);
```

## Naming your foreign key fields

By naming your foreign key along the lines of `author_id` or `author_fk`, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id serial primary key,
  author_id int not null references users,
  ...
);
```

We can automatically extract the field prefix: `author` and call the relation
`author` rather than the default: `user`. This allows for a post to have an
`author`, `editor`, `reviewer`, etc. all which point to `users`.

The reverse, however, is not so easy. On the User type, we can't call the
reverse of all these different relations `posts`. The default inflector refers
to these as `postsByAuthorId`, `postsByEditorId`, etc. However we'd rather use
shorter names, so we introduce a new inflector: `getOppositeBaseName`. This
inflector is passed a baseName (the part without the `_id`/`_fk` suffix, e.g.
`author`, `editor`, `reviewer` above) and should return the opposite of that
base name which will be prepended to the target type to produce, e.g.
`authoredPosts`, `editedPosts`, `reviewedPosts`. Failing this, we just fall back
to the default (verbose) inflector; it will be up to you to add smart comments
or a custom inflector to override these.

## Handling field conflicts:

In most cases, the conflict errors will guide you on how to fix these issues
using [smart comments](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/smart-comments/).

## Smart Tags

### `@foreignSimpleFieldName`

`@foreignSimpleFieldName` was added to override the naming of the foreign-side
of a one-to-many relationship's simple collections field (if you're using simple
collections). By default we'll take the `@foreignFieldName` and add the "list
suffix" ("List" by default, but "" if `pgOmitListSuffix` is set), but if you
prefer you can override it entirely with `@foreignSimpleFieldName`. If you set
`@foreignSimpleFieldName` and you're using `simpleCollections 'both'` then you
should also set `@foreignFieldName` explicitly or unexpected things may occur.

Applies to:

- foreign key constraints

### `@listSuffix`

`@listSuffix` allows you to override the default naming on a per-entity basis,
overriding `pgOmitListSuffix`. For example, with `pgOmitListSuffix: true`, you
can apply `@listSuffix include` to have the `-List` suffix appended to the
simple collection generated for that table, and remove the `-Connection` suffix
from the Relay connection. When `pgOmitListSuffix` is not `true`, you can use
`@listSuffix omit` to selectively omit the `-List` suffix on simple collections
and append `-Connection` to the Relay connection instead.

If `@listSuffix` is set, the only valid values are `"omit"` and `"include"`. Any
other value will cause an error.

|                   | @listSuffix omit    | @listSuffix include |
| ----------------: | :------------------ | :------------------ |
|  Relay Connection | companiesConnection | companies           |
| Simple Collection | companies           | companiesList       |

> NOTE: `@listSuffix` will have no effect when using `@foreignSimpleFieldName`.

Applies to:

- tables
- foreign key constraints
- computed column functions returning `SETOF <record type>`
